Dancers. Ever.”</em><br>\n—Riddlefiddle the Satyr, on ogres</blockquote><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26119178/gUYL9L5wzBVilz5UuWES6w/med.png?1481324438\"></div>Picture: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjAwNjY4ZTQzNzVl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Handout: Ogre</a><br><br><h2>Ogres</h2>\n\nOgres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of body. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.<br><br><strong><em>Furious Tempers.</em></strong> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre’s wrath in an instant—as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.<br><br><strong><em>Gruesome Gluttons.</em></strong> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre?has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry’s skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.<br><br><strong><em>Greedy Collectors.</em></strong> An ogre’s eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous “treasure” taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre’s trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.<br><br><strong><em>Legendary Stupidity.</em></strong> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don’t understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words—and then being eaten in turn.<br><br><strong><em>Primitive Wanderers.</em></strong> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.<br><br>\n\tAn ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.<br><br><strong><em>Ogre Gangs.</em></strong> Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.<br><br>\n\tWhenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants’ complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Greatclub</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>If any ogres are taken prisoner, charmed, or fast-talked, the characters learn relatively little.

Getting more than the basic rundown takes a DC 19 Charisma (Persuasion) check for each of the following three additional items:<br><br><ul><li>A vampire watches the Skyreach Castle at night. It sometimes feeds on the ogres, to their chagrin.</li><li>The cult uses the castle to visit important sites without roads or portals. The ogres don’t really know where they are other than “the green forests” and “that stretch of the moors” and “the old mountains.”</li><li>The castle’s mists and navigation are all controlled by the cloud giant’s magic. Without him, the castle won’t fly.</li></ul>\n\nThe last point is untrue, but it’s what Blagothkus told his ogres, and they believe him.<br><br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"giant","environment":"","cr":2,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":450},"source":"Roll

They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.<br><br><strong><em>Furious Tempers.</em></strong> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre’s wrath in an instant—as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.<br><br><strong><em>Gruesome Gluttons.</em></strong> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre?has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry’s skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.<br><br><strong><em>Greedy Collectors.</em></strong> An ogre’s eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous “treasure” taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre’s trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.<br><br><strong><em>Legendary Stupidity.</em></strong> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don’t understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words—and then being eaten in turn.<br><br><strong><em>Primitive Wanderers.</em></strong> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.<br><br>\n\tAn ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.<br><br><strong><em>Ogre Gangs.</em></strong> Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.<br><br>\n\tWhenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants.

As payment, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTZjZDc4ZDc3ZDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>trolls</a> demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRegeneration.</em></strong> Smashing a troll&#x2019;s bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll&#x2019;s wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll&#x2019;s flesh. The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTZjZDc4ZDc3ZDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>trolls</a>, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTroll Freaks.</em></strong> Their regenerative capabilities make <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTZjZDc4ZDc3ZDNi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>trolls</a> especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature&#x2019;s traits.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Keen Smell</strong>: The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.<br><br><strong>Regeneration</strong>: The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn&apos;t function at the start of the troll&apos;s next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn&apos;t regenerate.<br><br><strong>(Variant) Loathsome Limbs</strong>: Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:<br><br>\n1-10: Nothing else happens.<br>\n11-14: One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.<br>\n15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.<br>\n19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can&apos;t regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.<br><br>\nIf the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll&apos;s initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll&apos;s Regeneration trait.<br><br>\nA severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.<br><br>\nA severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.<br><br>\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet and the troll&apos;s Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.<br><br>\nThe troll&apos;s speed is halved if it&apos;s missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can&apos;t benefit from bonuses to speed.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>This four-armed troll is a demon-worshiper and a fanatical hunter of big game: nothing pleases him so much as bringing blood and bones back to feed his <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzJhNjE4YjEwMzRm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ambush drakes</a>, or the delightful terror of his more intelligent victims.

The travelers take such opportunities to hunt fresh meat for the larder. This herd, however, includes a magnificent stag that shimmers in the light as if its coat is spun from gold and its antlers plated with platinum. Nearly everyone in the caravan who can handle a bow wants to bring down that beast. Its pelt would be worth a fortune, even if it’s not real gold. A few of the more cautious types warn that the creature is clearly a blessed being and that killing it would bring bad luck on the caravan, but no more than two or three people are persuaded. In minutes, the hunt is on, and the deer herd scatters into the nearby forest and through farmers’ fields.<br><br>\nThe characters can join the chase, try to talk people down, protect the stag, or ignore the situation, as they see fit. It can be tracked through the forest with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check. A new check must be made every 500 yards.<br><br>\nThe stag leads hunters on a 1,500-yard chase (three Wisdom (Survival) checks) to a moss-grown, ivy-draped ruin in the forest. There, one of three things can happen. Choose the one that best suits your game.<br><br><ul><li>The golden stag can be cornered, fought, and killed. It is a normal stag but with a breathtakingly beautiful coat of golden fur. If the local farmers learn that it’s been killed, they grab their pitchforks and longbows and threaten to overrun the caravan unless they are paid 500 gp for their loss; the stag brought them luck.</li><li>The golden stag greets the characters in Sylvan. If none of the characters speak that language, it switches to Elvish, and if no one responds again, it tries heavily accented, pidgin Common. It assures them that they are on the right track, and they must continue following the river of gold until they reach the castle in the sky. Sadly, their path will be filled with hardship and blood. To aid them, it offers the character a +1 longbow. The bow appears on the ground before them, and then the stag fades from view saying, “Not all will survive . . .”</li><li>When the characters search the tumbled ruins, they find no sign of the golden stag but see a thin person who resembles a wood elf with bright golden skin. The young male is naked and either is wearing an antlered headpiece or has delicate antlers growing from his head. He drops to his knees and beseeches the characters in a dialect of Elvish that is archaic but understandable. He is an elf prince, and the stones around them were once the beautiful castle where he ruled. But he was cursed by the father of the woman he loved to transform into a golden stag whenever he steps outside these walls. He has lived with the curse for so long that his kingdom is forgotten, his castle is fallen to ruin, and he no longer remembers his own name. He believes that a wizard somewhere can release him from the curse, but wherever he goes, people try to kill him for his golden coat. If the characters allow him to accompany them and protect him, he will do his best to reward them at the end of the journey. The story is true; several wizards in Waterdeep could remove the curse. The elf cannot pay a reward at the end, but the characters earn 500 XP apiece for believing him and protecting him. That job won’t be easy, because people in the caravan find their story ridiculous and look for opportunities to kill the golden stag.</li></ul></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"beast","environment":"","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-4,"passive":6},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"traits":{"size":"lg","senses":"passive Perception 10","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":140000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/014_-_Golden_Stag/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Golden Stag","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/014_-_Golden_Stag/token.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":10,"brightSight":10,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"MTM4YWI5MzRmNmU1","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":13,"max":13},"bar2":{"value":10,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NjEzZWYwMzJiMzdh","flags":{},"name":"Charge.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/014_-_Golden_Stag/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If the golden stag moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) damage.

They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.<br><br>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.<br><br>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.<br><br>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.<br><br><h3>Dragon Age Categories</h3><table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age Range</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyrmling</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 years or less</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Young</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>6-100 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adult</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>101-800 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ancient</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>801 years or more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><h2>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</h2>Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant.<br><br>A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell’s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon’s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon’s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon’s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.<br><br><h2>Chromatic Dragons</h2>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures—including each other.<br><br><strong><em>Driven by Greed.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world’s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have “stolen” it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon’s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures of Ego.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon’s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.<br><br><strong><em>Dangerous Lairs.</em></strong> A dragon’s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.<br><br>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.<br><br><strong><em>Queen of Evil Dragons.</em></strong> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.<br><br>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her—black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.<br><br>Tiamat’s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen’s power.<br><br><h2>Black Dragon</h2>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.<br><br>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon’s face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon’s head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon’s reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.<br><br>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.<br><br><strong><em>Brutal and Cruel.</em></strong> All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.<br><br>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.<br><br><strong><em>Foes and Servants.</em></strong> Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.<br><br>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master’s domain.<br><br>A black dragon’s malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon’s lair.<br><br>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon’s hunger.<br><br><strong><em>Wealth of the Ancients.</em></strong> Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.<br><br><h2>A Black Dragon’s Lair</h2>Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon’s lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.<br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</li>\n<li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>\n<li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60 feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. If any of the effect’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>\n</ul><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region containing a legendary black dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li>\n<li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it within minutes.</li>\n<li>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.</li>\n</ul><br>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other effects fade over 1d10 days.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The dragon can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) acid damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Tail</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Frightful Presence</strong>: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><h2>Legendary Actions</h2>Can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn.<br><br><strong>Detect</strong>: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong>Tail Attack</strong>: The dragon makes a tail attack.<br><br><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.<br><br>","public":""},"race":"","type":"dragon","environment":"","cr":14,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":11500},"source":"Roll

They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze’s presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch.<br><br>\n\tOozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.<br><br><strong><em>Slow Death.</em></strong> An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim’s comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.<br><br>\n\tSince not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.<br><br><strong><em>Unwitting Servants.</em></strong> Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze’s need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.<br><br><strong><em>Spawn of Juiblex.</em></strong> According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.<br><br><strong><em>Ooze Nature.</em></strong> An ooze doesn’t require sleep.<br><br><h2>Gray Ooze</h2>\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/27611725/82HXFOCy0uQ1iu5IuCTHmg/med.png?1484858501\" style=\"float: left ; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px\">A gray ooze is stone turned to liquid by chaos.

Such occurrences are more common in gray oozes that live near psionic creatures such as mind flayers, suggesting that the ooze can sense and mimic psionic ability.

Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDark Desires.</em></strong> Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBorn from Death.</em></strong> Most of a vampire’s victims become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire’s hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master’s control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChained to the Grave.</em></strong> Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn’t receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Regeneration</strong>: The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.<br><br><strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br><strong>Vampire Weaknesses</strong>: The vampire has the following flaws: <br><br>\n• <em>Forbiddance.</em> The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.<br>\n• <em>Harmed by Running Water.</em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it ends its turn in running water.<br>\n• <em>Stake to the Heart.</em> The vampire is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into its heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place.<br>\n• <em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target, escape DC 13.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.","public":""},"race":"","type":"undead","environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["necrotic"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":530000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/053_-_Vampire_Spawn/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Vampire Spawn","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/053_-_Vampire_Spawn/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"MWQ3MDkwNGFmMzQ1","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":82,"max":82},"bar2":{"value":15,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NDk2Yjg1NGYwYjUx","flags":{},"name":"Regeneration.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/053_-_Vampire_Spawn/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water.

His &#x201C;religion&#x201D; is a mishmash of confused tradition, borrowed mysticism, hallucinogenic intoxicants, and manufactured lore that serves more as a road to personal power for Pharblex than as a spiritual system for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Yzc3OGE4YjYxNzYz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bullywugs</a>.

The only obstacle he sees between himself and his goal is the castle&#x2019;s current master, Dralmorrer Borngray; the notion that someone might want to not live in a swamp has never entered Pharblex&#x2019;s narrow mind, and the bullywug seems deaf to Borngray&#x2019;s ironic and sarcastic jabs at the mere. When the time is right, Pharblex plans to remove the elf from the picture by any means necessary. It is unlikely that he would choose the middle of a battle against the characters, when he and Borngray are fighting side by side, to betray the elf&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s not impossible. If it looks like the cult&#x2019;s operation at the castle is doomed, Pharblex is the sort of creature who will switch sides to save his slimy skin. The timing must be perfect, because he fears <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGU1YWIyMTA4YzYy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a> more than he fears the characters.

When they attack, griffons are as swift and deadly as eagles, even as they strike with a lion’s savage might and grace.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHorse Eaters.</em></strong> Griffons hunt in small prides, flying high over plains and forests near their rocky cliff-side aeries. Herd animals and horses are the prey they crave above all others, though they also hunt and kill hippogriffs. When it spots horses, a griffon screeches to alert its pride mates, which descend quickly toward their prey.<br><br>\n\tThose riding or herding horses dread the griffon’s piercing cry, preparing themselves for the bloody fight that inevitably follows. A griffon ignores a horse’s rider when possible, and a rider that abandons its mount, or a herder that releases one or two horses, can escape unharmed while the griffon targets its chosen prey. Riders who attempt to protect their horses attract the full fury of an attacking griffon.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSky Dwellers.</em></strong> Griffons lair in high rocky clifftop aeries, building their nests from sticks, leaves, and the bones of their prey. Once griffons establish a territory, they remain in that area until the food supply has been exhausted.<br><br>\n\tAggressive and territorial, griffons engage in brutal aerial combat to defend their aeries, tearing and shredding the wings of flying intruders to send them spiraling to the ground. Creatures that climb to a griffon’s lair are plucked from the cliffs and eaten, or are knocked from the heights to go tumbling to their deaths.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTrained Mounts.</em></strong> A griffon raised from an egg can be trained to serve as a mount. However, such training is time consuming, expensive (mostly for the ample food the creature requires), and dangerous. Expert trainers well versed in the griffon’s legendary ferocity are typically the only ones able to raise these creatures safely.<br><br>\n\tOnce trained, a griffon is a fierce and loyal steed. It bonds with one master for life, fighting to the death to protect that rider. A griffon mount retains its ravenous appetite for horseflesh, and a wise master ensures that a griffon remains satiated with other prey when passing through civilized lands.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Keen Sight</strong>: The griffon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The griffon

The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tElemental Spirit in Material Form.</em></strong> The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem’s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.<br><br>\n\tAfter constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem’s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAgeless Guardians.</em></strong> Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.<br><br>\n\tA golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBlind Obedience.</em></strong> When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can’t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently—or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.<br><br>\n\tA golem can’t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can’t be reasoned with or tricked with words.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConstructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h2>Stone Golem</h2>\nStone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form the sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant beasts.<br><br>\n\tLike other golems, stone golems are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made of stone themselves.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Immutable Form</strong>: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Magic Weapons</strong>: The golem's weapon attacks are magical.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The golem makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Slow (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 ft. of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>","public":""},"race":"","type":"construct","environment":"","cr":10,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":5900},"source":"Roll

Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDark Desires.</em></strong> Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBorn from Death.</em></strong> Most of a vampire’s victims become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire’s hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master’s control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChained to the Grave.</em></strong> Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn’t receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.<br><br><h2>Player Characters as Vampires</h2>\nThe game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire spawn and then a vampire don’t change, except that the character’s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren’t higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire’s damage resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire’s attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire’s proficiency bonus + the vampire’s Charisma modifier. The character’s alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a wish spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.<br><br><h2>Variants: Vampire Warriors and Spellcasters</h2>\nSome vampires have martial training and battlefield experience. Their entry can be found <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vampire Warrior\">here</a>.<br><br>\nSome vampires are practitioners of the arcane arts. Their entry can be found <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vampire Spellcaster\">here</a>.<br><br><h2>A Vampire’s Lair</h2>\n\nA vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.<br><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region surrounding a vampire’s lair is warped by the creature’s unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:<br><br>\n• There’s a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.<br>\n• Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.<br>\n• Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.<br>\n• A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire’s lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.<br><br>\nIf the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after 2d6 days.\n\n<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26896527/zJIHO4pECtYk1ck-5xpKyA/med.png?1483390855\"></div><br><br><h3 style=\"margin-left: 20px\">Strahd von Zarovich</h3>\n<div style=\"margin-left: 20px\">A brilliant thinker and capable warrior in life, Strahd von Zarovich fought in countless battles for his people. When war and killing finally stripped him of his youth and strength, he settled in the remote valley of Barovia and built a castle on a towering pinnacle, from which he could survey his lands. His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd’s adviser and constant companion.<br><br>\n\tIn his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost. Sergei was handsome and young, while Strahd had become old and scarred. Resentment colored their relationship, eventually turning into hatred. Strahd’s beloved, Tatyana, spurned him for Sergei, whom she pledged to marry.<br><br>\n\tIn a desperate attempt to win Tatyana’s heart, Strahd forged a pact with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft’s walls. Strahd’s guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire—the first vampire, according to many sages.<br><br>\n\tIn the centuries since his transformation, Strahd’s lust for life and youth have only grown. He broods in his dark castle, cursing the living for stealing away what he lost, and never admitting his hand in the tragedy he created.</div><br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Shapechanger</strong>: If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.<br><br>\nWhile in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br>\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.<br><br><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><strong>Misty Escape</strong>: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.<br><br>\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.<br><br><strong>Regeneration</strong>: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.<br><br><strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br><strong>Vampire Weaknesses</strong>: The vampire has the following flaws: <br><br>\n• <em>Forbiddance.</em> The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.<br>\n• <em>Harmed by Running Water.</em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.<br>\n• <em>Stake to the Heart.</em> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.<br>\n• <em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.<br><br><strong>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target, escape DC 18.<br><br><strong>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.<br><br><strong>Charm</strong>: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack.\n<br>Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.<br><br><strong>Children of the Night (1/Day)</strong>: The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.<br><br><h2>Legendary Actions</h2>\nCan take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn.<br><br><strong>Move</strong>: The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.<br><br><strong>Unarmed Strike</strong>: The vampire makes one unarmed strike.<br><br><strong>Bite (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The vampire makes one bite attack.","public":""},"race":"","type":"undead (shapechanger)","environment":"","cr":13,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10000},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":7,"passive":17},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":9,"passive":19},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 17","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["necrotic"],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":520000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/052_-_Vampire/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Vampire","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/052_-_Vampire/sides/*.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":125,"brightSight":120,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"N2RhN2FkN2EwZjA1","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":144,"max":144},"bar2":{"value":16,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"YjliYmU0ZDA5MTU2","flags":{},"name":"Shapechanger.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/052_-_Vampire/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.</p><p></p><p></p><p>While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet.

They have no society to speak of, but they do serve as mercenaries to orcs, ogres, ettins, hags, and giants. As payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRegeneration.</em></strong> Smashing a troll’s bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll’s wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll’s flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTroll Freaks.</em></strong> Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature’s traits.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Keen Smell</strong>: The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.<br><br><strong>Regeneration</strong>: The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.<br><br><strong>(Variant) Loathsome Limbs</strong>: Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:<br><br>\n1-10: Nothing else happens.<br>\n11-14: One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.<br>\n15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.<br>\n19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.<br><br>\nIf the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.<br><br>\nA severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.<br><br>\nA severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.<br><br>\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it.

Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.<br><br><strong><em>Goblinoids.</em></strong> Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.<br><br><strong><em>Martial Might.</em></strong> A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.<br><br>Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.<br><br><strong><em>Military Legions.</em></strong> Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.<br><br>As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.<br><br><strong><em>Strategic Thinkers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.<br><br>Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.<br><br><strong><em>Beast Trainers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.<br><br><strong><em>Conquer and Control.</em></strong> Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.<br><br>Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.<br><br>Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.<br><br><strong><em>Legion of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don’t fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron.<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26498292/ZD9YoSsb5a4SVoTW61N_1A/med.jpg?1482250480\"></div><br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Martial Advantage</strong>: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 10 (3d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn’t incapacitated.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The hobgoblin makes two greatsword attacks.<br><br><strong>Greatsword</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target.

In those lost days, these towering figures were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and traditions of old.<br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26356918/oPMyNtBYIwFBK_WMRP64rw/med.jpg?1481911332\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right ; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px\"><br><strong><em>\n\tOld as Legend.</em></strong> In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths, monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands, now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.<br><br>\n\tGiants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the giants’ heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race’s glorious dawn are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area without a fight.<br><br><h2>The Ordning</h2>\nEach of the main giant races—the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and storm giants—are related by common elements of history, religion, and culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.<br><br>\n\tGiants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in these qualities the purpose of their lives.<br><br>\n\tAt the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning, followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.<br><br>\n\tRegardless of a giant’s rank among its own race, the chief of a hill giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type. It isn’t considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.<br><br><h2>Stone Giant</h2>\nStone giants are reclusive, quiet, and peaceful as long as they are left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken eyes endow stone giants with a stern countenance. They are private creatures, hiding their lives and art away from the world.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tInhabitants of a Stone World.</em></strong> Secluded caves are the homes of the stone giants. Cavern networks are their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.<br><br>\n\tIn their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at elaborate carvings, measuring time in the echoing drip of water into cavern pools. In the deepest chambers of a stone giant settlement, far from the chittering of bats or the patrols paced out by the giants’ cave bear companions, are holy places where silence and darkness are complete. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that shames the legendary stonecraft of the dwarves.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCarvers and Seers.</em></strong> Among stone giants, artistry ranks as the greatest virtue. They create intricate murals, paint sprawling murals across cavern walls, and indulge in a wide variety of other artistic disciplines. They esteem stone carving as the greatest of skills.<br><br>\n\tStone giants strive to draw shapes out of raw stone, which they believe reveal meaning inspired by their god, Skoraeus Stonebones. The giants appoint the tribe’s best carvers as their leaders, shamans, and prophets. The holy hands of such giants become the hands of the god as they work.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGraceful Athletes.</em></strong> Despite their great size and musculature, stone giants are lithe and graceful. Skilled rock throwers are granted positions of high rank in the giants’ ordning, testing and demonstrating their ability to hurl and catch enormous boulders. Such giants take the front ranks when a tribe has cause to defend its home or attack its enemies. However, even in combat, artistry is key. A stone giant hurling a rock performs not just a feat of brute strength but also one of stunning athleticism and poise.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDreamers under Sky.</em></strong> Stone giants view the world outside their underground homes as a realm of dreams where nothing is entirely true or real. They behave in the surface world the way humanoids might behave in their own dreams, making little account for their actions and never fully trusting what they see or hear. A promise made above ground need not be kept. Insults can be made without apology. Killing prey or sentient beings is no cause for guilt in the dreaming world beneath the sky.<br><br>\n\tStone giants lacking in athletic grace or artistic skill dwell at the fringes of their society, serving as the tribe’s outlying guardians and far-wandering hunters. When trespassers stray too far into the mountain territory of a stone giant clan, those guardians greet them with hurled rocks and showers of splintered stone. Survivors of such encounters spread tales of stone giant violence, never realizing how little those brutes dwelling in the unreal dreaming world resemble their quiet and artistic kin.<br><br><blockquote>\n<em>\"And here is where Angerroth the barbarian fell against the giant horde. His bones are under that boulder over there.\"</em><br>\n—Elder Zelane of Istivin, recounting the Giant Wars</blockquote><br><h2>Giant Gods</h2>\nWhen the giants’ ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants’ pantheon.<br><br>\n\tChief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind’s primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam’s daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.<br><br>\n\tSome giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\">\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26358619/CERCNZJl8NvP-BmbpSZdUQ/med.jpg?1481913887\"><br>\n</div><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Stone Camouflage</strong>: The giant has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The giant makes two greatclub attacks.<br><br><strong>Greatclub</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Rock</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.<br><br>\n\tMany creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.<br><br>\n\tThough their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.<br><br>\n\tTrue dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.<br><br><h3>Dragon Age Categories</h3>\n\n<table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age Range</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyrmling</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 years or less</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Young</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>6-100 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adult</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>101-800 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ancient</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>801 years or more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><h2>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</h2>\nDragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant.<br><br>\nA young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell’s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon’s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon’s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon’s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.<br><br><h2>Chromatic Dragons</h2>\nThe black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures—including each other.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDriven by Greed.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world’s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have “stolen” it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon’s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCreatures of Ego.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon’s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDangerous Lairs.</em></strong> A dragon’s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.<br><br>\n\tMost chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tQueen of Evil Dragons.</em></strong> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.<br><br>\n\tTiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her—black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.<br><br>\n\tTiamat’s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen’s power.<br><br><h2>Blue Dragon</h2>\nVain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert’s reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.<br><br>\n\tA blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.<br><br>\n\tA blue dragon’s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tVain and Deadly.</em></strong> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.<br><br>\n\tA blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm’s reach as it waits to attack again.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDesert Predators.</em></strong> Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon’s eye.<br><br>\n\tWhen it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tOverlords and Minions.</em></strong> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.<br><br>\n\tA blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHoarders of Gems.</em></strong> Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.<br><br>\n\tA blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.<br><br><h2>A Blue Dragon’s Lair</h2>\nBlue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.<br><br>\n\tThunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon’s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon’s first line of defense.<br><br>\n\tA blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions—along with the wealth of the dead intruders.<br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3>\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>\n<li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>\n<li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair’s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li>\n</ul><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region containing a legendary blue dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>\n<li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can’t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (−5).</li>\n<li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon’s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>\n</ul><br>\nIf the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Tail</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Frightful Presence</strong>: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 ft. of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 ft. wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><h2>Legendary Actions</h2>Can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn.<br><br><strong>Detect</strong>: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong>Tail Attack</strong>: The dragon makes a tail attack.<br><br><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>The adult blue dragon Lennithon accompanied the raid on Greenest but is not an enthusiastic participant. Its chief contribution has been its Frightful Presence, but that becomes less effective as the night wears on and defenders overcome their fear. Shortly before midnight, the dragon launches a final assault against the citadel. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTdlMTg1MGMzODk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Frulam Mondath</a> orders the attack, knowing that the adventurers are in the keep at the time. Lennithon doesn’t consider this to be its fight, and it isn’t keen on tangling with adventurers for another’s benefit.<br><br>\nDuring this attack, Lennithon flies over the keep and uses his breath weapon without moving closer than 25 feet from the parapet. The defenders on the walls have mastered their fear of the dragon’s Frightful Presence from earlier attacks. There are twenty NPC defenders on the walls at the beginning of the mission, and more can arrive between attacks to take the place of those who fall. The dragon doesn’t target the adventures at first, and every breath attack not directed at them kills 1d4 NPC defenders and injures 1d6 more. Adventurers who happen to get caught in the area make normal saving throws and take standard damage. The NPCs’ attacks are ineffective against Lennithon. Bear in mind that the dragon’s breath weapon will kill a 1st-level character outright, so be sure to demonstrate its destructive power to the players before turning the dragon against the party.<br><br>\nAfter each attack, Lennithon swoops away until his breath weapon recharges, then swings in for another attack. He repeats this pattern until it has taken 24 damage or more, or a single critical hit. After that happens, Lennithon leaves for good.<br><strong><br>\n</strong><em><strong>Rewards.</strong> </em>Characters earn 50 XP each for driving away Lennithon, but reduce that award to 25 XP if 10 or more defenders were killed during the attack.<br><br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"dragon","environment":"","cr":16,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":15000},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":7,"passive":17},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":12,"passive":22},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12}},"traits":{"size":"huge","senses":"blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 22","languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["lightning"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":20000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/002_-_Adult_Blue_Dragon/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Adult Blue Dragon","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/002_-_Adult_Blue_Dragon/token.png","tint":null,"width":3,"height":3,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":135,"brightSight":120,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"NjEyZWQ0NmMwNDc4","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":225,"max":225},"bar2":{"value":19,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NWY3OWU4Yzg0MTFi","flags":{},"name":"Legendary Resistance (3/Day).","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/002_-_Adult_Blue_Dragon/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":"","units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":0,"charged":false},"featType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"time":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true}},"sort":10000},{"_id":"ZTY3ODY2MTg1NzE0","flags":{},"name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/002_-_Adult_Blue_Dragon/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong>Multiattack.</strong>.</p><p>The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.

Their hut villages thrive in forbidding grottos, half-sunken ruins, and watery caverns.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTerritorial Xenophobes.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJkNTdjMTIzOWFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lizardfolk</a> deal and trade with other races only rarely. Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Njc5MmMwYmNkMDQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>crocodiles</a> and other dangerous creatures.<br><br>\n\tLizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.<br><br>\n\tLizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don&#x2019;t like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.<br><br>\n\tOccasions might arise when lizardfolk will form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firsthand that humans, dwarves, halflings, and elves can sometimes prove helpful or trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast and fierce allies.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGreat Feasts and Sacrifices.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJkNTdjMTIzOWFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lizardfolk</a> are omnivorous, but they have a taste for humanoid flesh. Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat. Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to Semuanya, the lizardfolk god.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCanny Crafters.</em></strong> Though they aren&#x2019;t skilled artisans, lizardfolk craft tools and ornamental jewelry out of the bones of their kills, and they use the hides and shells of dead monsters to create shields.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLizardfolk Leaders.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJkNTdjMTIzOWFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lizardfolk</a> respect and fear magic with a religious awe. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJkNTdjMTIzOWFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lizardfolk</a> shamans lead their tribes, overseeing rites and ceremonies performed to honor Semuanya. From time to time, however, a lizardfolk tribe produces a powerful figure touched not by Semuanya but by Sess&#x2019;inek&#x2014;a reptilian demon lord who seeks to corrupt and control the lizardfolk.<br><br>\n\tLizardfolk born in Sess&#x2019;inek&#x2019;s image are larger and more cunning than other lizardfolk, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard kings and queens dominate lizardfolk tribes, usurping a shaman&#x2019;s authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDragon Worshipers.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTJkNTdjMTIzOWFh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Lizardfolk</a> speak Draconic, which they are thought to have learned from dragons in ancient times. A tribe that wanders into the territory of a dragon will offer it tribute to win its favor. An evil dragon might exploit lizardfolk for its own vile ends, turning them into raiders and plunderers.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Hold Breath</strong>: The lizardfolk can hold its breath for 15 minutes.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The lizardfolk makes two melee attacks, each one with a different weapon.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Heavy Club</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>:<em> Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Spiked Shield</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>This lizardfolk, whose name is <strong>Snapjaw</strong>, is unhappy about the situation in the Mere of Dead Men, and he develops the notion that these strangers could be the key to driving out the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWU2NTlhNDBiMTlm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> and to slaughtering their cruel bullywug allies. Snapjaw tries to communicate with the chosen character, but he doesn&#x2019;t want any of his comrades to know. He speaks enough pidgin Common to converse in simple terms, in case no one in the party speaks Draconic.<br><br>\nHow Snapjaw goes about opening a dialog depends on the situation. If he&#x2019;s the only surviving lizardfolk or he&#x2019;s questioned out of earshot from the others, he can speak openly. If several lizardfolk are tied up and they&#x2019;re being questioned together, he could sprinkle words of Common into his Draconic replies, such as &#x201C;want to help&#x201D; and &#x201C;talk alone.&#x201D; If several lizardfolk are tied up and left alone for a few minutes, he could scratch a similar message into the ground. He might try provoking a character into a wrestling match or a duel (if your players are the type to take up such a challenge), and then whisper his message into the character&#x2019;s ear.<br><br>\nIf characters don&#x2019;t mistreat Snapjaw and don&#x2019;t kill any more lizardfolk than they need to, he becomes a reliable ally for as long as they work against the cult and the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Yzc3OGE4YjYxNzYz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bullywugs</a>. Roll a die for each of the other lizardfolk captives. On an even roll, Snapjaw persuades that lizardfolk to join his little revolt.

A roper eats any creature, from Underdark beasts to adventurers and their gear.<br><br>\n\tA roper has the appearance of a stalagmite or stalactite, which often allows it to attack with surprise. The creature can move slowly using thousands of sticky cilia beneath its base. It creeps up cave walls and along stone ceilings, finding the best position from which to attack.<br><br><strong><em>Underdark Hunters.</em></strong> The roper is an evolved, mature form of piercer, with which it shares its rock-like appearance and hunting tactics. A roper can hold still for long hours, shutting its single eye to look like nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. Creatures that come too close are surprised when that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils shoot out to seize them. The roper then makes horrible guttural sounds as it reels in its struggling victims, drawing them close for the fatal bite of its stony teeth.<br><br>\n\tA roper can digest anything it eats with the exception of platinum, gemstones, and magic items, which can sometimes be retrieved from the creature’s gizzard after death. A roper’s digestive juices are also valuable, fetching a high price from alchemists who use them as a solvent.<br><br><strong><em>Weakening Tendrils.</em></strong> A roper has six nubs set along its body, through which it extrudes sticky tendrils that bond to whatever they touch. Each tendril sends out hair-like growths that penetrate a creature’s flesh and sap its strength, so the victim can struggle only weakly as the roper reels it in. If a tendril is cut through or broken, the roper produces a new one to replace it.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>False Appearance</strong>: While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.<br><br><strong>Grasping Tendrils</strong>: The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it.<br><br><strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Tendril</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> The target is grappled, escape DC 15. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the same tendril on another target.<br><br><strong>Reel</strong>: The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 ft. straight toward it.","public":""},"race":"","type":"monstrosity","environment":"","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13}},"traits":{"size":"lg","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 16","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":370000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/037_-_Roper/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Roper","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/037_-_Roper/token.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":70,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"NmMzNWE4ZGUwNWNi","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":93,"max":93},"bar2":{"value":20,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NzAyNzVjODM5YWNj","flags":{},"name":"False Appearance.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/037_-_Roper/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":0,"units":""},"target":{"value":"","units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":"","long":"","units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":0,"charged":false},"featType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"time":{"value":"","_deprecated":true},"damageType":{"value":"","_deprecated":true}},"sort":10000},{"_id":"OTg3YzI5YWU1MzY2","flags":{},"name":"Grasping Tendrils.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/037_-_Roper/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time.

A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAnimate Stone.</em></strong> Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDeadly Reputation.</em></strong> Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCruel Servants.</em></strong> Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master’s home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage.<br><br>\n\tGargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls. Gargoyles have the patience and fortitude of stone, and will serve even the cruelest master for years without complaint.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tElemental Nature.</em></strong> A gargoyle doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h2>Shards of Elemental Evil</h2>\nAs Ogrémoch, the evil Prince of Elemental Earth, treads his stony realm, it leaves shards of broken rock in his wake. Imbued with slivers of sentience, these shards thrum with the essence of the elemental prince, growing over long years into vaguely humanoid rock formations that resolve at last into the hard, cruel shapes of gargoyles.<br><br>\n\tOgrémoch doesn’t create gargoyles deliberately, but they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogrémoch despises. They are heavy creatures of living stone, yet capable of flight. Like their creator, they possess a fundamental hatred for beings of elemental air, aarakocra in particular, and relish every opportunity to destroy such creatures.<br><br>\n\tOn their home plane, gargoyles carve out earth motes that Ogrémoch hurtles into Aaqa, the domain of the aarakocra and the benevolent Wind Dukes the bird folk serve in the Elemental Plane of Air.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>False Appearance</strong>: While the gargoyle remains motion less, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The gargoyle makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to

The orcs believe that in ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.<br><br>\n\tOrcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god’s eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering elves.

After savaging a settlement, orcs pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came, their bloodlust satisfied.<br><br><strong><em>Ranging Scavengers.</em></strong> Their lust for slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes’ villages into fortified camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats and trenches.<br><br>\n\tWhen an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack, the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to carve a bloody path to its new territory.<br><br>\n\tOn rare occasions, a tribe’s leader chooses to hold onto a particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.<br><br><strong><em>Leadership and Might.</em></strong> Orc tribes are mostly patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows, Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of overwhelming strength.<br><br>\n\tStrength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs, and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.<br><br><strong><em>Orc Crossbreeds.</em></strong> Luthic, the orc goddess of fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation. The orcs’ drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race, and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Aggressive</strong>: As a bonus

Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGoblinoids.</em></strong> Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMartial Might.</em></strong> A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.<br><br>\n\tHobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMilitary Legions.</em></strong> Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.<br><br>\n\tAs loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStrategic Thinkers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.<br><br>\n\tLegions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBeast Trainers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConquer and Control.</em></strong> Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.<br><br>\n\tHobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.<br><br>\n\tHobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLegion of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don’t fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron.<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26498292/ZD9YoSsb5a4SVoTW61N_1A/med.jpg?1482250480\"></div><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Martial Advantage</strong>: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft. of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Longsword (One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Longsword (Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Longbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target.

When it kills a humanoid, a peryton rips out its prey’s heart and takes it back to its nest to be devoured.<br><br>\n\tThe peryton is a bizarre creature that blends the body and wings of a bird of prey with the head of a stag. Its strangest feature is its shadow, which appears humanoid rather than reflecting the creature’s physical form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were humans transformed by a hideous curse or magical experiment, but bards tell a different tale of a man whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the heart of her younger, more beautiful rival and consume it in a ritual intended to forever win her husband’s heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman’s villainy was exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the lingering magic of her foul ritual caused the carrion birds that feasted on her corpse to transform into the first perytons.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUnnatural Hunger.</em></strong> A peryton’s reproductive cycle depends on the heart of a freshly killed humanoid. The organ must be consumed by a female peryton before she can reproduce. When a peryton consumes a heart, its shadow changes for a brief time to reflect its true monstrous form.<br><br>\n\tWhen attacking a humanoid, a peryton is single-minded and relentless, fighting until it or its prey dies. If a peryton is somehow driven away, it stalks lost prey from afar, attacking again when the opportunity arises.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBane of the Mountains.</em></strong> Perytons roost atop mountain ridges and lair in high caves. They prey on creatures living or wandering in the vales below, and travelers on lonely mountain roads learn to keep a wary eye on the sky. Because normal weapons are less effective against perytons, the folk of the mountains know to avoid confrontations with these monsters at all costs.<br><br>\n\tEstablished settlements are attractive to perytons as a renewable food source. As such, village councils and local nobles often hire adventurers to eliminate peryton nests.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Dive Attack</strong>: If the peryton is flying and dives at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a melee weapon attack, the attack deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage to the target.<br><br><strong>Flyby</strong>: The peryton doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.<br><br><strong>Keen Sight and Smell</strong>: The peryton has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The peryton makes one gore attack and one talon attack.<br><br><strong>Gore</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Talons</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing

Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStealing Secrets.</em></strong> A doppelganger’s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn’t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature’s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature’s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHedonistic Swindlers.</em></strong> Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim’s riches.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChangelings.</em></strong> Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother’s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Ambusher</strong>: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Read Thoughts</strong>: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><strong>Arietta </strong>and <strong>Zelina Innevar</strong> take a liking to some of the travelers—possibly, but not necessarily, a few of the characters—and spend the evening asking about their past, where they’re headed, whether they have family, and so on. The sisters are actually two doppelgangers. They can either attack someone that night or join the caravan for a few days while they study the travelers and choose their victims. When the time comes to strike, they wait until after dark, then try to lure their target away from other people by calling for assistance in a familiar voice. Fortunately for the characters and their fellow travelers, if one is defeated, the other flees in a flurry of curses and vengeful threats.<br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"monstrosity (shapechanger)","environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"Roll 20","class":" 1"},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":2,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed"],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"Yjk3OTIzMGUxZTVh","sort":710000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/071_-_Zelina_Innevar/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Zelina Innevar","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/071_-_Zelina_Innevar/sides/*.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"OTE0MjMzMWYwMjE5","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":52,"max":52},"bar2":{"value":14,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"ZWI3ZTMwMDU5ZTRl","flags":{},"name":"Shapechanger.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/071_-_Zelina_Innevar/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form.

Resembling an animated suit of empty plate armor, a helmed horror serves without ambition or emotion.<br><br><strong><em>Magical Purpose.</em></strong> Though it takes more magical resources to create a helmed horror than a lesser suit of animated armor, the helmed horror requires less direction and maintenance as it carries out its appointed tasks.

Unlike many constructs, it seeks to fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter.<br><br><strong><em>Tactical Cunning.</em></strong> A helmed horror fights with the cunning of a skilled warrior, taking to the air as it attacks weaker characters and spellcasters first. However, a helmed horror lacks the insight to change its environment, fortify it, or otherwise take active measures to improve its defensive position.<br><br><strong><em>Constructed Nature.</em></strong> A helmed horror doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The helmed horror has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Spell Immunity</strong>: The helmed horror is immune to three spells chosen by its creator.

Their hut villages thrive in forbidding grottos, half-sunken ruins, and watery caverns.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTerritorial Xenophobes.</em></strong> Lizardfolk deal and trade with other races only rarely. Fiercely territorial, they use camouflaged scouts to guard the perimeter of their domain. When unwelcome visitors are detected, a tribe sends a hunting band to harass or drive the trespassers off, or tricks them into blundering into the lairs of crocodiles and other dangerous creatures.<br><br>\n\tLizardfolk have no notion of traditional morality, and they find the concepts of good and evil utterly alien. Truly neutral creatures, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive.<br><br>\n\tLizardfolk rarely stray beyond their claimed hunting grounds. Any creature that enters their territory is fair game to be stalked, killed, and devoured. They make no distinction between humanoids, beasts, and monsters. Similarly, lizardfolk don’t like reaching too far beyond their borders, where they could easily become the hunted instead of the hunters.<br><br>\n\tOccasions might arise when lizardfolk will form alliances with their neighbors. These lizardfolk usually learn firsthand that humans, dwarves, halflings, and elves can sometimes prove helpful or trustworthy. Once lizardfolk forge ties with outsiders, they are steadfast and fierce allies.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tGreat Feasts and Sacrifices.</em></strong> Lizardfolk are omnivorous, but they have a taste for humanoid flesh. Prisoners are often taken back to their camps to become the centerpieces of great feasts and rites involving dancing, storytelling, and ritual combat. Victims are either cooked and eaten by the tribe, or are sacrificed to Semuanya, the lizardfolk god.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCanny Crafters.</em></strong> Though they aren’t skilled artisans, lizardfolk craft tools and ornamental jewelry out of the bones of their kills, and they use the hides and shells of dead monsters to create shields.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLizardfolk Leaders.</em></strong> Lizardfolk respect and fear magic with a religious awe. Lizardfolk shamans lead their tribes, overseeing rites and ceremonies performed to honor Semuanya. From time to time, however, a lizardfolk tribe produces a powerful figure touched not by Semuanya but by Sess’inek—a reptilian demon lord who seeks to corrupt and control the lizardfolk.<br><br>\n\tLizardfolk born in Sess’inek’s image are larger and more cunning than other lizardfolk, and are thoroughly evil. These lizard kings and queens dominate lizardfolk tribes, usurping a shaman’s authority and inspiring uncharacteristic aggression among their subjects.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDragon Worshipers.</em></strong> Lizardfolk speak Draconic, which they are thought to have learned from dragons in ancient times. A tribe that wanders into the territory of a dragon will offer it tribute to win its favor. An evil dragon might exploit lizardfolk for its own vile ends, turning them into raiders and plunderers.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Hold Breath</strong>: The lizardfolk can hold its breath for 15 minutes.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The lizardfolk makes two melee attacks, each one with a different weapon.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Heavy Club</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>:<em> Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Spiked Shield</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>The lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men are reluctant allies of the cult, mostly because Dralmorrer Borngray allows the more numerous bullywugs to push them around. The odds are 50 percent whether a group of lizardfolk works for the cult or is independent. An independent group helps the characters if <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjVkNTRhZmMwZWIw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Snapjaw</a> is present to persuade them. They won’t tackle the cult or a large group of bullywugs head-on, but they can help by scouting and creating diversions. Lizardfolk that do work for the cult attack immediately if they see Snapjaw tied like a prisoner. If Snapjaw is loose and characters don’t seem hostile toward him, the lizardfolk hesitate, wondering whether the characters are cultists themselves.<br><br>All the lizardfolk, Snapjaw included, are terrified of “the weed that walks,” the shambling mound in the Mere of the Dead Men. If it appears while Snapjaw is with the characters, he spends 1 round urging the characters to flee, then does so himself. Unless someone follows him immediately, it will take an hour to find him again.<br><br> Three power groups operate around Castle Naerytar: the Cult of the Dragon, a band of bullywugs, and a lizardfolk tribe. The black dragon Voaraghamanthar, along with its kobold and lizardfolk minions, could constitute a fourth group if it took an active hand in events, but for now it is biding its time to see how events develop.<br><br>\nRezmir’s three-way alliance is unstable. The cultists despise living in the swamp and have little respect for the bullywugs or lizardfolk; the leader of the bullywugs would like to seize Castle Naerytar for his own purposes; the bullywugs in general take every opportunity to push around the lizardfolk; and the lizardfolk chafe under the abuse of the bullywugs and wonder why Voaraghamanthar doesn’t step in to protect them.<br><br>The Scaly Death lizardfolk tribe has no leader. Pharblex killed its shaman, Suncaller, and the death left the tribe with an inferiority complex that was ripe for exploitation. When Rezmir promised that Voaraghamanthar would reward the tribe’s labors for the cult, the lizardfolk were ready to listen.<br><br>\nWhere the bullywugs fill the role of a static defense force, the lizardfolk perform five functions. First, they are the cult’s laborers and porters. Lizardfolk did most of the heavy work while clearing debris from the castle, and they carry most of the treasure from the work camp to the castle on their backs and in their canoes. Second, they tend the giant lizards that are used to drag or carry especially heavy loads through the mere. Third, they do most of the hunting, fishing, and gathering to feed everyone at the castle. Fourth, they act as the castle’s far-ranging scouts and outlying guards, since they are far superior to any bullywug at actively patrolling, ambushing, and laying traps. Fifth, a cadre of lizardfolk has been enlisted as elite guards for the castle itself. Borngray doesn’t expect that any force would ever mount a real attack against the castle; it’s too inaccessible, lying deep in the swamp. But if that unlikely event ever happened, he knows that the swaggering bullywugs would desert rather than fight an organized enemy. The lizardfolk, on the other hand, can be courageous and disciplined when they have a leader worth following. Borngray hopes to be that leader, at least to the small contingent of lizardfolk warriors he houses in the castle and rewards with special treatment. In exchange for their work, Borngray “pays” the tribe in metal weapons that are brought to the castle along with the loot.<br><br>\nLike the bullywugs, the lizardfolk’s first assumption on seeing strangers is that they are cultists, or allies of the cultists, come to work or parley at the castle. They don’t share the bullywugs’ arrogance, however, so unless they are attacked, they don’t really care who wanders through the camp. Lizardfolk on patrol or standing guard are an exception. They are alert, and they assume everyone is a potential enemy. They won’t attack until they know for sure, lest they incur the wrath of Rezmir or Borngray for killing an ally. As outlying guards, their instructions are to alert the camp when strangers approach, keep the strangers under observation, and await further instructions.<br><br><br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"humanoid (lizardfolk)","environment":"","cr":0.5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":100},"source":"Roll

My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears down stone into sand.&quot;</em><br>&#x2014;Count Strahd von Zarovich</blockquote><div style=\"text-align: center\"></div><h2>Vampires</h2>\n\nAwakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDark Desires.</em></strong> Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBorn from Death.</em></strong> Most of a vampire&#x2019;s victims become vampire spawn&#x2014;ravenous creatures with a vampire&#x2019;s hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master&#x2019;s control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2RhN2FkN2EwZjA1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Vampire</a> spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChained to the Grave.</em></strong> Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn&#x2019;t receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tUndead Nature.</em></strong> Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.<br><br><h2>Player Characters as Vampires</h2>\nThe game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire spawn and then a vampire don&#x2019;t change, except that the character&#x2019;s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren&#x2019;t higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire&#x2019;s damage resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire&#x2019;s attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire&#x2019;s proficiency bonus + the vampire&#x2019;s Charisma modifier. The character&#x2019;s alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a wish spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.<br><br><h2>A Vampire&#x2019;s Lair</h2>\n\nA vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.<br><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region surrounding a vampire&#x2019;s lair is warped by the creature&#x2019;s unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:<br><br>\n&#x2022; There&#x2019;s a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.<br>\n&#x2022; Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.<br>\n&#x2022; Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.<br>\n&#x2022; A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire&#x2019;s lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.<br><br>\nIf the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after 2d6 days.\n\n<br><br><div style=\"text-align: center\"></div><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Shapechanger</strong>: If the vampire isn&apos;t in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.<br><br>\nWhile in bat form, the vampire can&apos;t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br>\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can&apos;t take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature&apos;s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can&apos;t pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.<br><br><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><strong>Misty Escape</strong>: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn&apos;t in sunlight or running water. If it can&apos;t transform, it is destroyed.<br><br>\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can&apos;t revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.<br><br><strong>Regeneration</strong>: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn&apos;t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn&apos;t function at the start of the vampire&apos;s next turn.<br><br><strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br><strong>Vampire Weaknesses</strong>: The vampire has the following flaws: <br><br>\n&#x2022; <em>Forbiddance.</em> The vampire can&apos;t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.<br>\n&#x2022; <em>Harmed by Running Water.</em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.<br>\n&#x2022; <em>Stake to the Heart.</em> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire&apos;s heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.<br>\n&#x2022; <em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.<br><br><strong>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target, escape DC 18.<br><br><strong>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target&apos;s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire&apos;s control.<br><br><strong>Charm</strong>: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn&apos;t under the vampire&apos;s control, it takes the vampire&apos;s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire&apos;s bit attack.\n<br>Each time the vampire or the vampire&apos;s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.<br><br><strong>Children of the Night (1/Day)</strong>: The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn&apos;t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.<br><br><h2>Legendary Actions</h2>\nCan take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature&apos;s turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn.<br><br><strong>Move</strong>: The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.<br><br><strong>Unarmed Strike</strong>: The vampire makes one unarmed strike.<br><br><strong>Bite (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The vampire makes one bite attack.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><strong>Sandesyl Morgia</strong> is a moon elf who joined the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjAwMzYxYjM2ZTk4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cult of the Dragon</a> long before she became undead.

They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even druids can’t charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Echolocation</strong>: The swarm can't use its blindsight while deafened.<br><br><strong>Keen Hearing</strong>: The swarm has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.<br><br><strong>Swarm</strong>: The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny bat.

They lair deep in remote forests.<br><br>\n\tFine strands of silk stream from glands in an ettercap’s abdomen, letting it shoot sticky strands of webbing to bind, entrap, or strangle its victims. It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tQuiet Killers.</em></strong> When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap’s territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSylvan Despoilers.</em></strong> Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the ettercaps’ victims.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tEnemies of the Fey.</em></strong> Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad’s tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures themselves.<br><br><h2>Variant: Web Garrote</h2>\nSome ettercaps like to strangle prey using garrotes fashioned from webbing. An ettercap so armed gains the Web Garrote action option (listed in Actions), which it uses in place of its claws.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The ettercap can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br><strong>Web Sense</strong>: While in contact with a web, the ettercap knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.<br><br><strong>Web Walker</strong>: The ettercap ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The ettercap makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit</em>: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Web (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one Large or smaller creature. <em>Hit</em>: The creature is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 11 Strength check, escaping from the webbing on a success. The effect ends if the webbing is destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, is vulnerable to fire damage and immune to bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Variant: Web Garrote</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature against which the ettercap has advantage on the attack roll. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled, escape DC 12. Until this grapple ends, the target can't breathe, and the ettercap has advantage on attack rolls against

All the servants are making things ready for their arrival.&#x201D; (This is pure nonsense, of course&#x2014;he has no rooms other than his own.) If the characters just wait a moment, Raggnar says he will offer them his own chambers, for a steep fee of 10 gp. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll clear out a few things and it is all yours.&#x201D; This is also a stalling tactic, though he&#x2019;ll certainly take the money.<br><br>\nBecause the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWU2NTlhNDBiMTlm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> are about to ship a castle full of treasure from the village, they desperately don&#x2019;t want the characters to find anything suspicious, such as wagons loaded with chests (there&#x2019;s no room to hide a caravan in a village this small) or their wyvern mounts in the stables (see area 3).

Kobolds inhabit dragons’ lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.<br><br><strong><em>Strength in Numbers.</em></strong> Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be “great wyrms” more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.<br><br><strong><em>Tunnelers and Builders.</em></strong> Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.<br><br><strong><em>The Lost God.</em></strong> In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat’s vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen’s hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak’s most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.<br><br><strong><em>Winged Kobolds.</em></strong> A few kobolds are born with leathery wings and can fly. Known as urds, they like to lurk on high ledges and drop rocks on passersby. Although the urds’ wings are seen as gifts from Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, wingless kobolds are envious of those gifts and don’t get along with the urds.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><strong>Pack Tactics</strong>: The kobold has

Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLiving Elements.</em></strong> On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tConjured by Magic.</em></strong> Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tBound and Shaped.</em></strong> Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.<br><br>\n\tThe strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can’t bind elemental power sufficiently.

When they activate their lights, will-o’-wisps offer hope, hinting of safety to creatures that follow them.<br><br> Will-o’-wisps lure unwary creatures into quicksand pits, monster lairs, and other dangerous places so that they can feed on the suffering of their prey and revel in their death screams. An evil being that falls prey to a will-o’-wisp might become a wisp itself, its woeful spirit coalescing above its lifeless corpse like a flickering flame.<br><br><strong><em>Consumed by Despair.</em></strong> Will-o’-wisps are the souls of evil beings that perished in anguish or misery as they wandered forsaken lands permeated with powerful magic. They thrive in swampy bogs and bone-strewn battlefields where the oppressive weight of sorrow stoops even heavier than the low-hanging mist and fog. Trapped in these desolate places of lost hope and memory, will-o’-wisps lure other creatures toward dismal fates and feed on their misery.<br><br><strong><em>Agents of Evil.</em></strong> Will-o’-wisps rarely speak, but when they do, their voices sound like faint or distant whispers. In the miserable domains they haunt, will-o’-wisps sometimes form symbiotic relationships with their wicked neighbors. Hags, oni, black dragons, and evil cultists work with will-o’-wisps to draw creatures into ambush. As their evil allies surround and slaughter creatures, the wisps hover above them, drinking the agony of a last breath and savoring the sensation as the light of life goes out in a creature’s eyes.<br><br><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A will-o’-wisp doesn’t require air, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Consume Life</strong>: As a bonus action, the will-o’-wisp can target one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive.

When not commanded, they follow the last order they received to the best of their ability, and can act independently to fulfill simple instructions. Some animated objects (including many of those created in the Feywild) might converse fluently or adopt a persona, but most are simple automatons.<br><br><strong><em>Constructed Nature.</em></strong> An animated object doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep. <br><br>The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.<br><br><h2>Rug of Smothering</h2>Would-be thieves and careless heroes arrive at the doorsteps of an enemy’s abode, eyes and ears alert for traps, only to end their quest prematurely as the rugs beneath their feet animate and smother them to death.<br><br>A rug of smothering can be made in many different forms, from a finely woven carpet fit for a queen to a coarse mat in a peasant’s hovel.

From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts, the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races and to make themselves gods.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tForsaken Humanity.</em></strong> The yuan-ti were once humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent’s sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSerpent Kings of Fallen Empires.</em></strong> The yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCold of Heart.</em></strong> Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an exploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and the events of its own life with such extreme pragmatism that it is nearly impossible to manipulate, influence, or control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks to control other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can’t be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tFalse Worship.</em></strong> Yuan-ti life revolves around their temples, yet yuan-ti don’t love the gods they worship. Instead, they see worship as a means to attain power. A yuan-ti believes an individual who attains enough power can devour and replace one of the yuan-ti gods. The yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit the darkest atrocities to achieve it.<br><br><h2>Yuan-ti Malison</h2>\nA malison is a hideous blend of human and serpentine features. Three different types of malisons are known to exist, and other types are possible. Malisons form the middle caste of yuan-ti society and hunt with arrows tipped with their own venom. They use their magical powers of suggestion to force their enemies’ surrender.<br><br><h3>Malison Types</h3>\nThe yuan-ti has one of the following types. Each type has its own entry in the compendium (Yuan-ti Malison Type 1, Yuan-ti Malison Type 2, Yuan-ti Malison Type 3):<br><br><strong>\nType 1:</strong> Human body with snake head<br><strong>\nType 2:</strong> Human head and body with snakes for arms<br><strong>\nType 3:</strong> Human head and upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26932709/9ECFlYFCvIrUc-Gq_42kkA/med.png?1483480114\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right ; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px\"><h2>Serpent Gods</h2>\nThe yuan-ti revere a number of powerful entities as gods, including the following.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDendar, the Night Serpent.</em></strong> Dendar’s followers say that one day she will grow so large from feasting on the fears and nightmares of the world that she will devour it whole. Yuan-ti that serve Dendar terrorize other creatures in any way they can, growing and nurturing the fears of humanoids to feed the Night Serpent.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMerrshaulk, Master of the Pit.</em></strong> Merrshaulk is the long-slumbering chief deity of the yuan-ti. As worship of Merrshaulk waned, he went into slumber. Merrshaulk’s priests are yuan-ti abominations that maintain traditions of living sacrifice and cause suffering in the god’s name. With enough vile acts, the abominations believe that Merrshaulk will reawaken and restore the yuan-ti to their rightful place.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSseth, the Sibilant Death.</em></strong> Sseth appeared to the yuan-ti of antiquity in the form of a winged yuan-ti claiming to be an avatar of Merrshaulk. Speaking with Merrshaulk’s voice, Sseth vowed to pull the yuan-ti out of decline and build a new empire. Many of Merrshaulk’s devout turned to the worship of Sseth. Some yuan-ti have long suspected Sseth as an usurper taking advantage of Merrshaulk’s slumber to make himself a god. They believe that Sseth might even have devoured Merrshaulk, and now answers the prayers of Merrshaulk’s followers, as his priests convert or consume Merrshaulk’s more stubborn adherents.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium snake, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It doesn’t change form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting (Abomination Form Only)</strong>: The yuan‑ti’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The yuan-ti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br>\n• At will: <em>animal friendship</em> (snakes only)<br>\n• 3/day: <em>suggestion</em><br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Malison Type</strong>: Type 2. Human head and body with snakes for arms.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack (Abomination Form Only)</strong>: The yuan-ti makes two bite attacks using its snake arms.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>All residents of the mere, including the lizardfolk, the cultists, and especially the bullywugs, fear and despise the yuan-ti. For their part, the yuan-ti despise everyone right back, but they have no fear. This group of two yuan-ti malisons (type 1) and three yuan-ti purebloods is hunting for any intelligent creatures that would be suitable sacrifices to their long-slumbering god Merrshaulk. Yuan-ti won’t ally with anyone or against anyone.</section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"monstrosity (shapechanger","environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11","languages":{"value":["abyssal","common","draconic"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZmFkMzZmNDRmYjkz","sort":600000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/060_-_Yuan-ti_Malison_Type_2/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Yuan-ti Malison Type 2","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/060_-_Yuan-ti_Malison_Type_2/sides/*.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"YjM4MTFmNDk3NmVj","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":66,"max":66},"bar2":{"value":12,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"YzA1OGRhYWI0YTIx","flags":{},"name":"Shapechanger.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/060_-_Yuan-ti_Malison_Type_2/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium snake, or back into its true form.

Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStealing Secrets.</em></strong> A doppelganger’s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn’t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature’s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature’s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHedonistic Swindlers.</em></strong> Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim’s riches.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChangelings.</em></strong> Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother’s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Ambusher</strong>: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Read Thoughts</strong>: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.<br>","public":""},"race":"","type":"monstrosity (shapechanger)","environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":2,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed"],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":130000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/013_-_Doppelganger/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Doppelganger","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/013_-_Doppelganger/token.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"YjU0MDExZWRkZWE1","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":52,"max":52},"bar2":{"value":14,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NDU4ZGUxMmMzMGFj","flags":{},"name":"Shapechanger.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/013_-_Doppelganger/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form.

From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts, the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races and to make themselves gods.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tForsaken Humanity.</em></strong> The yuan-ti were once humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent’s sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSerpent Kings of Fallen Empires.</em></strong> The yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCold of Heart.</em></strong> Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an exploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and the events of its own life with such extreme pragmatism that it is nearly impossible to manipulate, influence, or control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks to control other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can’t be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tFalse Worship.</em></strong> Yuan-ti life revolves around their temples, yet yuan-ti don’t love the gods they worship. Instead, they see worship as a means to attain power. A yuan-ti believes an individual who attains enough power can devour and replace one of the yuan-ti gods. The yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit the darkest atrocities to achieve it.<br><br><h2>Yuan-ti Pureblood</h2>\nPurebloods form the lowest caste of yuan-ti society. They closely resemble humans, yet a pureblood can’t pass for human under close scrutiny because there’s always some hint of its true nature, such as scaly patches of skin, serpentine eyes, pointed teeth, or a forked tongue. Wearing cloaks and cowls, they masquerade as humans and infiltrate civilized lands to gather information, kidnap prisoners for interrogation and sacrifice, and trade with anyone who has something that can further their myriad plots.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26932709/9ECFlYFCvIrUc-Gq_42kkA/med.png?1483480114\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right ; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px\"><h2>Serpent Gods</h2>\nThe yuan-ti revere a number of powerful entities as gods, including the following.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDendar, the Night Serpent.</em></strong> Dendar’s followers say that one day she will grow so large from feasting on the fears and nightmares of the world that she will devour it whole. Yuan-ti that serve Dendar terrorize other creatures in any way they can, growing and nurturing the fears of humanoids to feed the Night Serpent.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMerrshaulk, Master of the Pit.</em></strong> Merrshaulk is the long-slumbering chief deity of the yuan-ti. As worship of Merrshaulk waned, he went into slumber. Merrshaulk’s priests are yuan-ti abominations that maintain traditions of living sacrifice and cause suffering in the god’s name. With enough vile acts, the abominations believe that Merrshaulk will reawaken and restore the yuan-ti to their rightful place.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSseth, the Sibilant Death.</em></strong> Sseth appeared to the yuan-ti of antiquity in the form of a winged yuan-ti claiming to be an avatar of Merrshaulk. Speaking with Merrshaulk’s voice, Sseth vowed to pull the yuan-ti out of decline and build a new empire. Many of Merrshaulk’s devout turned to the worship of Sseth. Some yuan-ti have long suspected Sseth as an usurper taking advantage of Merrshaulk’s slumber to make himself a god. They believe that Sseth might even have devoured Merrshaulk, and now answers the prayers of Merrshaulk’s followers, as his priests convert or consume Merrshaulk’s more stubborn adherents.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The yuan-ti’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). The yuan-ti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br>\n• At will: <em>animal friendship </em>(snakes only)<br>\n• 3/day each: <em>poison spray, suggestion</em><br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The yuan-ti makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Scimitar</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Shortbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>All residents of the mere, including the lizardfolk, the cultists, and especially the bullywugs, fear and despise the yuan-ti.

The wyrmspeaker wants to know how much Leosin has learned and with whom he shared his information. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGU1YWIyMTA4YzYy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a> considered it an amazing stroke of luck that Leosin was captured during the raid.<br><br>\nIn fact, it wasn&#x2019;t luck at all, at least not for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGU1YWIyMTA4YzYy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a>. Leosin had studied their previous attacks and concluded that the time was right for the cult to strike a bigger target, and he knew that Greenest was prosperous yet poorly defended, making it the most likely next target. So, when he deemed the time was just about right, he visited the town with the intent of staying until something happened. His observations paid off, and Leosin separated from his people during the night and fell in with the raiders when they retreated, hoping to learn more about the cult&#x2019;s plans and the location of their camp. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGU1YWIyMTA4YzYy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a> spotted him after the sun came up, and the monk was quickly overpowered and captured.<br><br>\nThat portion of Leosin&#x2019;s scheme has worked reasonably well. He now knows most of the information listed below:<br><br><ul><li>This is a camp of the Cult of the Dragon&#x2014;praise Tiamat&#x2019;s glory! (Some cultists extend their right hand with fingers outstretched to represent the five heads of Tiamat when they praise her glory. Others curl back two fingers, to show that Tiamat&#x2019;s strength is hidden. This is not mandatory, but adepts and hard-core cultists look favorably on those who do it sincerely.)</li><li>Not everyone here is a full-fledged member of the cult. Many are new initiates working toward full acceptance, and many others are simple mercenaries, hired to flesh out the camp&#x2019;s strength during raids or if it should come under attack.</li><li>The kobolds are here because their worshipful attitude toward dragons makes them easy for Rezmir and other high-ranking cultists to manipulate, but they are not well liked or trusted by the other races.</li><li>Hunters who bring in antelope and other large game from the grasslands feed the camp. The cultists and their allies eat most of it, but some is stored in the cave to feed the hatchlings.</li><li>The cult has been ranging far and wide on small raids to collect treasure. Greenest was the closest target to the camp, the biggest of all the towns they&#x2019;ve attacked, and the most profitable&#x2014;praise Tiamat&#x2019;s glory!</li><li>Prisoners are used for manual labor. In the past, a few have &#x201C;converted&#x201D; and become loyal members of the cult, but most die eventually of overwork and undernourishment. Then they are fed to the drakes or taken into the cave to feed the hatchlings.</li><li>The cave at the back of the camp is off-limits to all but those who&#x2019;ve been cleared by Mondath and Rezmir, which includes a handful of guards and kobolds. It&#x2019;s known around camp as &#x201C;the nursery,&#x201D; and it&#x2019;s an open secret that Rezmir plans to hatch a clutch of dragon eggs there.</li><li>The half-black dragon Rezmir came to the area a few months ago, and she set up the camp. Mondath handles everyday operations.</li><li>The half-blue dragon Cyanwrath is Mondath&#x2019;s right hand and is seldom far from her side. He has a rigid sense of honor, but you don&#x2019;t want to make him angry.</li><li>The mother of dragons&#x2014;praise Tiamat&#x2019;s glory&#x2014;shall return, and when that day comes, all the nations of the world shall tremble before her majesty!</li><li>The plunder from nearby settlements is stored in the cave. No one but Rezmir knows how much is there altogether, but it must be a big pile by now.</li></ul><br>Unfortunately for him, captivity has been more brutal than he expected, and although his mind and will are still strong, he&#x2019;s in a very poor physical state.<br><br>\nDespite the danger, Leosin isn&#x2019;t entirely happy about being rescued if characters come to set him free. He believes he can learn more, and he&#x2019;s willing to take the risk. He&#x2019;s too weak to resist, however, so characters can easily take him away against his will if that&#x2019;s what they want to do. He can move without aid at a speed of 20 feet and fights as a commoner with disadvantage on attack rolls. If characters don&#x2019;t bring him out of the camp, Leosin breaks away on his own. He refuses to talk about it later.<br><br>\nIf characters are captured and imprisoned alongside Leosin and their attempts to escape fall through, he reveals that he has a small knife hidden in his boot. They can use it to cut their bonds. Leosin&#x2019;s absence is noticed within five minutes if he is taken away, and an alarm goes up throughout the camp.

These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil, bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.<br><br>Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.<br><br><strong><em>Foul Aristocracy.</em></strong> Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader—a self-styled lord of the muck. Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and endlessly vie to win their superiors’ favor.<br><br>A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it’s more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.<br><br><strong><em>Unruly Diplomacy.</em></strong> Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.<br><br>Captives are dragged before the king or queen—a bullywug of unusually large size—and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its “guests” with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.<br><br><strong><em>Amphibian Allies.</em></strong> Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.<br><br>Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs’ ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The bullywug can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Speak with Frogs and Toads</strong>: The bullywug can communicate simple concepts to frogs and toads when it speaks in Bullywug.<br><br><strong>Swamp Camouflage</strong>: The bullywug has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.<br><br><strong>Standing Leap</strong>: The bullywug’s long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.\n<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The bullywug makes two melee attacks: one with its bite and one with its spear.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Spear (Melee; One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Spear (Melee; Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Spear (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjAwMzYxYjM2ZTk4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cult of the Dragon</a> has moved people into <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzgxMzdkODljNDNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Castle Naerytar</a> and formed shaky alliances with nearby swamp dwellers, but the surrounding swampland is far from under anyone’s control. The cult brought lizardfolk, bullywugs, and a pair of black dragons together in an unstable alliance, but the factions are riven by deep distrust that outsiders can exploit.<br><br>Bullywugs patrol the Mere of Dead Men haphazardly. Before characters reach the midway campsite, this encounter is with two bullywugs per character. After characters reach the midway campsite, this encounter is with three bullywugs per character. Not all bullywugs in the mere work for the cult, but any the characters run into do.<br><br>Rezmir’s three-way alliance is unstable. The cultists despise living in the swamp and have little respect for the bullywugs or lizardfolk; the leader of the bullywugs would like to seize Castle Naerytar for his own purposes; the bullywugs in general take every opportunity to push around the lizardfolk; and the lizardfolk chafe under the abuse of the bullywugs and wonder why Voaraghamanthar doesn’t step in to protect them.<br><br>The band of bullywugs serving the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjAwMzYxYjM2ZTk4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Cult of the Dragon</a> follows the dictates of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWZkNDIzNTFlZmQw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Pharblex Spattergoo</a>, a rare bullywug who has mastered shamanistic magic. His “religion” is a mishmash of confused tradition, borrowed mysticism, hallucinogenic intoxicants, and manufactured lore that serves more as a road to personal power for Pharblex than as a spiritual system for the bullywugs. Pharblex’s spellcasting holds his followers together, and that makes him useful to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGU1YWIyMTA4YzYy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a>.<br><br>The bullywugs already believe themselves to be lords of the mere, and they act like it. They are easily confused, however. Under normal circumstances, they attack adventurers on sight, provided the bullywugs had superior numbers. They have grown accustomed to seeing cultists of many races coming and going around the castle, so when they see strangers, their first assumption is that the newcomers are more cultists. This assumption is reinforced if <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjVkNTRhZmMwZWIw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Snapjaw</a> or other lizardfolk accompany the strangers or if the characters have any overtly cultish gear or clothing.<br><br>This doesn’t mean characters can wander at will through the camp and the castle. Bullywug guards still challenge them to ask who they are and where they’re going (in fractured pidgin Common if none of the characters speak Bullywug). They just don’t assume that every stranger is an enemy and attack on sight.<br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"humanoid

From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts, the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races and to make themselves gods.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tForsaken Humanity.</em></strong> The yuan-ti were once humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent’s sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSerpent Kings of Fallen Empires.</em></strong> The yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCold of Heart.</em></strong> Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an exploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and the events of its own life with such extreme pragmatism that it is nearly impossible to manipulate, influence, or control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks to control other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can’t be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tFalse Worship.</em></strong> Yuan-ti life revolves around their temples, yet yuan-ti don’t love the gods they worship. Instead, they see worship as a means to attain power. A yuan-ti believes an individual who attains enough power can devour and replace one of the yuan-ti gods. The yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit the darkest atrocities to achieve it.<br><br><h2>Yuan-ti Malison</h2>\nA malison is a hideous blend of human and serpentine features. Three different types of malisons are known to exist, and other types are possible. Malisons form the middle caste of yuan-ti society and hunt with arrows tipped with their own venom. They use their magical powers of suggestion to force their enemies’ surrender.<br><br><h3>Malison Types</h3>\nThe yuan-ti has one of the following types. Each type has its own entry in the compendium (Yuan-ti Malison Type 1, Yuan-ti Malison Type 2, Yuan-ti Malison Type 3):<br><br><strong>\nType 1:</strong> Human body with snake head<br><strong>\nType 2:</strong> Human head and body with snakes for arms<br><strong>\nType 3:</strong> Human head and upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26932709/9ECFlYFCvIrUc-Gq_42kkA/med.png?1483480114\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right ; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px\"><h2>Serpent Gods</h2>\nThe yuan-ti revere a number of powerful entities as gods, including the following.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDendar, the Night Serpent.</em></strong> Dendar’s followers say that one day she will grow so large from feasting on the fears and nightmares of the world that she will devour it whole. Yuan-ti that serve Dendar terrorize other creatures in any way they can, growing and nurturing the fears of humanoids to feed the Night Serpent.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMerrshaulk, Master of the Pit.</em></strong> Merrshaulk is the long-slumbering chief deity of the yuan-ti. As worship of Merrshaulk waned, he went into slumber. Merrshaulk’s priests are yuan-ti abominations that maintain traditions of living sacrifice and cause suffering in the god’s name. With enough vile acts, the abominations believe that Merrshaulk will reawaken and restore the yuan-ti to their rightful place.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSseth, the Sibilant Death.</em></strong> Sseth appeared to the yuan-ti of antiquity in the form of a winged yuan-ti claiming to be an avatar of Merrshaulk. Speaking with Merrshaulk’s voice, Sseth vowed to pull the yuan-ti out of decline and build a new empire. Many of Merrshaulk’s devout turned to the worship of Sseth. Some yuan-ti have long suspected Sseth as an usurper taking advantage of Merrshaulk’s slumber to make himself a god. They believe that Sseth might even have devoured Merrshaulk, and now answers the prayers of Merrshaulk’s followers, as his priests convert or consume Merrshaulk’s more stubborn adherents.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium snake, or back into its true form.

Specters no longer possess connections to who or what they were, yet are condemned to walk the world forever. Some are spawned when dark magic or the touch of a wraith rips a soul from a living body.<br><br><strong><em>Beyond Redemption.</em></strong> When a ghost’s unfinished business is completed, it can rest at last. No such rest or redemption awaits a specter. It is doomed to the Material Plane, its only end the oblivion that comes with the destruction of its soul. Until then, it bears out its lonely life in forlorn places, carrying on forgotten through the ages of the world.<br><br><strong><em>Undying Hatred.</em></strong> Living creatures remind the specter that life is beyond its grasp. The mere sight of the living overwhelms a specter with sorrow and wrath, which can be abated only by destroying said life. A specter kills quickly and mercilessly, for only by depriving others of life can it gain the slightest satisfaction. However, no matter how many lives it extinguishes, a specter always succumbs to its hatred and sorrow.<br><br><strong><em>Dwellers in Darkness.</em></strong> Sunlight represents a source of life that no specter can ever hope to douse, and it pains them. When night falls, they leave their final resting places in search of living creatures to slay, knowing that few weapons can harm them in return. At the first light of dawn, they retreat back into the darkness, where they remain until night falls again.<br><br><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A specter doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><h3>Variant: Poltergeist</h3>\nA poltergeist is a different kind of specter — the confused, invisible spirit of an individual with no sense of how he or she died. A poltergeist expresses its rage by hurling creatures and objects using the power of its shattered psyche. The Poltergeist stat block can be found <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/monstermanual/Monsters:Poltergeist#content\">here</a>.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>: The specter can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br><br><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the specter has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Life Drain</strong>: <em>Melee Spell Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>Several years after its builder and original owner abandoned <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzgxMzdkODljNDNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Castle Naerytar</a>, the castle was re-occupied by an all-female school of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers. A few years after the astrologers moved in, they were wiped out by their own leader. Several of the castle’s residents were murdered in this topmost room of the northwest tower in particularly hideous fashion. They are still here in the form of three specters haunting the chamber. They rest quietly, ignoring everything and everyone in the castle, until someone opens the trapdoor and enters.<br><br>\nThe open chamber contains a large table and star charts in scroll racks around the walls.

Two rubbery tentacles end in spiky, leaf-like appendages that the otyugh uses to shovel food into its gaping maw.<br><br>\n\tAn otyugh buries itself under mounds of offal and carrion, leaving only its sensory stalk exposed. When an edible creature happens by, the otyugh’s tentacles erupt from the filth and grab hold of it.<br><br>\n\tOtyughs make the most of any opportunity to ambush and devour prey. They use a limited form of telepathy to urge sentient creatures toward their lairs, sometimes by pretending to be something else.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDwellers in Darkness.</em></strong> Otyughs tolerate bright light only when considerable stores of carrion or garbage lie within reach. In the wilderness, they dwell in stagnant swamps, scum-filled ponds, and damp forest dells. The scent of graveyards, city sewers, village middens, and manure-filled animal pens attracts them to civilized areas.<br><br>\n\tSince otyughs lack concern for anything but food, their nests sometimes accumulate a variety of treasures shed from their victims and mixed among the junk.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSymbiotic Guardians.</em></strong> Sentient subterranean beings can coexist with otyughs, employing them as garbage disposals. With such plentiful sustenance, otyughs grow fat in their wallows, unmoved by any other drive or desire. This sedentary gluttony makes them reliable guardians. As long as it is fed, an otyugh refrains from attacking other creatures. However, would-be otyugh masters can easily underestimate the quantity of waste, carrion, and meat necessary to keep an otyugh from wandering off in search of food. More than one “trained” otyugh has eaten its keeper after devouring all the waste in its wallow.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Limited Telepathy</strong>: The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 ft. of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5, 1d10, on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.<br><br><strong>Tentacle</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled, escape DC 13, and restrained until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.<br><br><strong>Tentacle Slam</strong>: The otyugh slams creatures grappled by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be stunned until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't stunned.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>The northwest tower of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzgxMzdkODljNDNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Castle Naerytar</a> (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZThjMWE2ZmMzNTQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Inside Castle Naerytar - Ground Floor</a>) is home to an otyugh that consumes much of the castle&#x2019;s garbage. When characters arrive, it is sitting quietly submerged in the muck, making it undetectable unless characters stir the foul-smelling stuff with poles. If someone steps into the muck or leaps to the steps, the otyugh lashes out with its tentacles. A grappled character is dragged into the pit where, along with all the hazards of being savaged by an otyugh, there is the added danger of drowning. It&#x2019;s safe to assume that characters entering this tower will take a big gulp of clean air first, but the otyugh&#x2019;s attack might knock the wind out of them. Allow the attacked character to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 plus the damage caused by the otyugh&#x2019;s tentacle attack. A successful saving throw means the character has a lungful of air when dragged into the muck and can hold his or her breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + his or her Constitution modifier, with a minimum of 30 seconds (5 rounds). Failure means the character&#x2019;s lungs are empty, and the character falls unconscious at the end of his or her turn after a number of rounds equal to the character&#x2019;s Constitution modifier unless the character breaks free from the otyugh&#x2019;s grasp before then.

This rotting heap of animated vegetation looms up half again as tall as a human, tapering into a faceless “head” at its top.<br><br><strong><em>All-Consuming Devourers.</em></strong> A shambling mound feeds on any organic material, tirelessly consuming plants as it moves and devouring animals that can’t escape it. Only the shambling mounds’ rarity and plodding speed prevent them from overwhelming entire ecosystems. Even so, their presence leeches natural environments of plant and animal life, and an unsettling quiet pervades the swamps and woods haunted by these ever-hungry horrors.<br><br><strong><em>Unseen Hunters.</em></strong> Composed of decaying leaves, vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost, shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures. Rather, they remain in place, sustaining themselves by absorbing nutrients from their surroundings as they wait for prey to come to them. When a creature passes near or alights upon a shambling mound, the monster comes to life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey.<br><br><strong><em>Spawned by Lightning.</em></strong> A shambling mound results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it, mulching their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots eventually give up their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out new sources of food.<br><br><strong><em>The Weed that Walks.</em></strong> The instinct that drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere inside its ponderous form. The rest of a shambler consists of the rotting heap that it simultaneously accumulates and feeds on, which protects the root-stem and animates to smash and smother the life from any creature.<br><br>\n\tThe dense mass of a shambling mound’s body shrugs off the effects of cold and fire. Lightning reinvigorates the root-stem, strengthening the shambling mound and bolstering its consumptive drive.\n\tDespite its monstrous form, the shambling mound is a living plant that requires air and nourishment. Although it doesn’t sleep the way an animal does, it can lie dormant for days on end before rising to hunt for food.<br><br><strong><em>A Resurgent Menace.</em></strong> If a shambling mound faces defeat before an overwhelming foe, the root-stem can feign death, collapsing the remains of its mound. If not subsequently killed, the root-stem beds down in the shambler’s remains to slowly regrow its full body, then once again sets out to consume all it can. In this way, shambling mound infestations long thought destroyed can recur time and again.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Lightning Absorption</strong>: Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled, escape DC 14, and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Engulf</strong>: The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>All the lizardfolk, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjVkNTRhZmMwZWIw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Snapjaw</a> included, are terrified of “the weed that walks.” If it appears while Snapjaw is with the characters, he spends 1 round urging the characters to flee, then does so himself.

Kobolds inhabit dragons’ lairs when they can but more commonly infest dungeons, gathering treasures and trinkets to add to their own tiny hoards.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStrength in Numbers.</em></strong> Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be “great wyrms” more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTunnelers and Builders.</em></strong> Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids. Kobolds also riddle their lairs with traps. The most insidious kobold traps make use of natural hazards and other creatures. A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tThe Lost God.</em></strong> In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat’s vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen’s hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak’s most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tWinged Kobolds.</em></strong> A few kobolds are born with leathery wings and can fly. Known as urds, they like to lurk on high ledges and drop rocks on passersby. Although the urds’ wings are seen as gifts from Tiamat, the Dragon Queen, wingless kobolds are envious of those gifts and don’t get along with the urds.

From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and deserts, the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races and to make themselves gods.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tForsaken Humanity.</em></strong> The yuan-ti were once humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent’s sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSerpent Kings of Fallen Empires.</em></strong> The yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCold of Heart.</em></strong> Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as an exploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and the events of its own life with such extreme pragmatism that it is nearly impossible to manipulate, influence, or control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks to control other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can’t be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.<br><br>\n\tYuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses. They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tFalse Worship.</em></strong> Yuan-ti life revolves around their temples, yet yuan-ti don’t love the gods they worship. Instead, they see worship as a means to attain power. A yuan-ti believes an individual who attains enough power can devour and replace one of the yuan-ti gods. The yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit the darkest atrocities to achieve it.<br><br><h2>Yuan-ti Malison</h2>\nA malison is a hideous blend of human and serpentine features. Three different types of malisons are known to exist, and other types are possible. Malisons form the middle caste of yuan-ti society and hunt with arrows tipped with their own venom. They use their magical powers of suggestion to force their enemies’ surrender.<br><br><h3>Malison Types</h3>\nThe yuan-ti has one of the following types. Each type has its own entry in the compendium (Yuan-ti Malison Type 1, Yuan-ti Malison Type 2, Yuan-ti Malison Type 3):<br><br><strong>\nType 1:</strong> Human body with snake head<br><strong>\nType 2:</strong> Human head and body with snakes for arms<br><strong>\nType 3:</strong> Human head and upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26932709/9ECFlYFCvIrUc-Gq_42kkA/med.png?1483480114\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right ; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px\"><h2>Serpent Gods</h2>\nThe yuan-ti revere a number of powerful entities as gods, including the following.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDendar, the Night Serpent.</em></strong> Dendar’s followers say that one day she will grow so large from feasting on the fears and nightmares of the world that she will devour it whole. Yuan-ti that serve Dendar terrorize other creatures in any way they can, growing and nurturing the fears of humanoids to feed the Night Serpent.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tMerrshaulk, Master of the Pit.</em></strong> Merrshaulk is the long-slumbering chief deity of the yuan-ti. As worship of Merrshaulk waned, he went into slumber. Merrshaulk’s priests are yuan-ti abominations that maintain traditions of living sacrifice and cause suffering in the god’s name. With enough vile acts, the abominations believe that Merrshaulk will reawaken and restore the yuan-ti to their rightful place.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tSseth, the Sibilant Death.</em></strong> Sseth appeared to the yuan-ti of antiquity in the form of a winged yuan-ti claiming to be an avatar of Merrshaulk. Speaking with Merrshaulk’s voice, Sseth vowed to pull the yuan-ti out of decline and build a new empire. Many of Merrshaulk’s devout turned to the worship of Sseth. Some yuan-ti have long suspected Sseth as an usurper taking advantage of Merrshaulk’s slumber to make himself a god. They believe that Sseth might even have devoured Merrshaulk, and now answers the prayers of Merrshaulk’s followers, as his priests convert or consume Merrshaulk’s more stubborn adherents.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium snake, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It doesn’t change form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting (Abomination Form Only)</strong>: The yuan‑ti’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The yuan-ti can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br>\n• At will: <em>animal friendship </em>(snakes only)<br>\n• 3/day: <em>suggestion</em><br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Malison Type</strong>: Type 1. The yuan-ti has a human body with a snake head.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack (Yuan-ti Form Only)</strong>: The yuan-ti makes two ranged attacks or two melee attacks, but can use its bite only once.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.<br><br><strong>Scimitar (Yuan-ti Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Longbow (Yuan-ti Form Only)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>All residents of the mere, including the lizardfolk, the cultists, and especially the bullywugs, fear and despise the yuan-ti. For their part, the yuan-ti despise everyone right back, but they have no fear. This group of two yuan-ti malisons (type 1) and three yuan-ti purebloods is hunting for any intelligent creatures that would be suitable sacrifices to their long-slumbering god Merrshaulk.

These cousins to the great dragons hunt the same tangled forests and caverns as their kin. Their appearance sends ripples of alarm through the borderlands of civilization.<br><br>\n\tA wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern’s stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim’s bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAerial Hunters.</em></strong> A wyvern doesn’t fight on the ground unless it can’t reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn’t an option. If forced into a confrontation on the ground, a wyvern crouches low, keeping its stinger poised above its head as it hisses and growls.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tAggressive and Reckless.</em></strong> A wyvern intent on its prey backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows.<br><br>\n\tAlthough they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTamed Wyverns.</em></strong> A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern’s violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2>\n\n<strong>Multiattack</strong>: The wyvern makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger. While flying, it can use its claws in place of one other attack.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claws</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Stinger</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>Any character can put the harness on a wyvern with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the wyvern strenuously objects and attacks the character once with its tail stinger as a reaction. The wyverns aren’t choosy about who rides them, but convincing a wyvern to fly or move in a specific direction requires an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check; if the check fails, the wyvern ignores the rider’s commands until the rider’s next turn. After a rider succeeds on two such checks, the wyvern goes where the rider wants for the next hour, or until it takes damage or the rider dismounts.<br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"dragon","environment":"","cr":6,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":2300},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":-2,"passive":8},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-3,"passive":7},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"traits":{"size":"lg","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14","languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":580000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/058_-_Wyvern/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Wyvern","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/058_-_Wyvern/token.png","tint":null,"width":2,"height":2,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":70,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ZTgzYTE1NTk0ZmQx","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":110,"max":110},"bar2":{"value":13,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"NjNkOWNjZmVjZDg3","flags":{},"name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/058_-_Wyvern/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><p><strong>Multiattack.</strong>.</p><p>The wyvern makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

Few creatures spread fear, suspicion, and deceit better than doppelgangers. Found in every land and culture, they can take on the guise of any individual of any race.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tStealing Secrets.</em></strong> A doppelganger’s adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn’t impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature’s surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature’s name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim’s mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tHedonistic Swindlers.</em></strong> Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con. While one doppelganger takes the place of a murdered merchant or noble, the others take on a number of identities as circumstances warrant, playing the parts of family or servants while they live off the victim’s riches.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tChangelings.</em></strong> Doppelgangers are too lazy or self-interested to raise their young. They assume attractive male forms and seduce women, leaving them to raise their progeny. A doppelganger child appears to be a normal member of its mother’s species until it reaches adolescence, at which point it discovers its true nature and is driven to seek out its kind to join them.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br><strong>Ambusher</strong>: In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.<br><br><strong>Surprise Attack</strong>: If the doppelganger surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Read Thoughts</strong>: The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 ft. of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 ft. of wood or dirt, 2 ft. of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><strong>Arietta </strong>and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTE0MjMzMWYwMjE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Zelina Innevar</a></strong> take a liking to some of the travelers—possibly, but not necessarily, a few of the characters—and spend the evening asking about their past, where they’re headed, whether they have family, and so on. The sisters are actually two doppelgangers. They can either attack someone that night or join the caravan for a few days while they study the travelers and choose their victims. When the time comes to strike, they wait until after dark, then try to lure their target away from other people by calling for assistance in a familiar voice. Fortunately for the characters and their fellow travelers, if one is defeated, the other flees in a flurry of curses and vengeful threats.<br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"monstrosity (shapechanger)","environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":2,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":3,"passive":13},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":2,"passive":12},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":4,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"traits":{"size":"med","senses":"darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11","languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed"],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"folder":"Yjk3OTIzMGUxZTVh","sort":700000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/070_-_Arietta_Innevar/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Arietta Innevar","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/070_-_Arietta_Innevar/sides/*.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":65,"brightSight":60,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ZWFmMmYzMmFkOGUz","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":52,"max":52},"bar2":{"value":14,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":true},"items":[{"_id":"YWMyYWRjM2EyYzk0","flags":{},"name":"Shapechanger.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/070_-_Arietta_Innevar/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form.

They have no society to speak of, but they do serve as mercenaries to orcs, ogres, ettins, hags, and giants. As payment, trolls demand food and treasure. Trolls are difficult to control, however, doing as they please even when working with more powerful creatures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tRegeneration.</em></strong> Smashing a troll’s bones and slashing through its rubbery hide only makes it angry. A troll’s wounds close quickly. If the monster loses an arm, a leg, or even its head, those dismembered parts can sometimes act with a life of their own. A troll can even reattach severed body parts, untroubled by its momentary disability. Only acid and fire can arrest the regenerative properties of a troll’s flesh. The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTroll Freaks.</em></strong> Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature’s traits.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2>\n\n<strong>Keen Smell</strong>: The troll has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.<br><br><strong>Regeneration</strong>: The troll regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.<br><br><strong>(Variant) Loathsome Limbs</strong>: Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time, roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:<br><br>\n1-10: Nothing else happens.<br>\n11-14: One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs left.<br>\n15- 18: One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms left.<br>\n19-20: The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.<br><br>\nIf the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.<br><br>\nA severed leg is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.<br><br>\nA severed arm has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.<br><br>\nIf its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its body is blinded unless the head can see it. The severed head has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.<br><br>\nThe troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved.

They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.<br><br>\n\tMany creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.<br><br>\n\tThough their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.<br><br>\n\tTrue dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.<br><br><h3>Dragon Age Categories</h3>\n\n<table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Category</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Age Range</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wyrmling</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>5 years or less</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Young</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>6-100 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adult</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>101-800 years</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ancient</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>801 years or more</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table><h2>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</h2>\nDragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant.<br><br>\nA young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell’s level can be no higher than one-third the dragon’s challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon’s bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon’s spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier.<br><br><h2>Chromatic Dragons</h2>\nThe black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures—including each other.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDriven by Greed.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world’s wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have “stolen” it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon’s hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tCreatures of Ego.</em></strong> Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon’s personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tDangerous Lairs.</em></strong> A dragon’s lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.<br><br>\n\tMost chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tQueen of Evil Dragons.</em></strong> Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.<br><br>\n\tTiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her—black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.<br><br>\n\tTiamat’s most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen’s power.<br><br><h2>White Dragon</h2>\nThe smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.<br><br>\n\tA white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tPrimal and Vengeful.</em></strong> White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.<br><br>\n\tA white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon’s lair as warnings to intruders.<br><br>\n\tThough only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tLone Masters.</em></strong> White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.<br><br>\n\tWhite dragons can’t abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon’s wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.<br><br>\n\tPowerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon’s obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon’s lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.<br><br><strong><em>\n\tTreasure Under Ice.</em></strong> White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.<br><br>\n\tLoose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon’s lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon’s breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon’s great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon’s main hoard.<br><br>\n\tA white dragon’s flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.<br><br><h2>A White Dragon’s Lair</h2>\nWhite dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.<br><br>\n\tA legendary white dragon’s innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon’s presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.<br><br>\n\tA white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.<br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3>\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</li>\n<li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>\n<li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall’s space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li>\n</ul><br><h3>Regional Effects</h3>\nThe region containing a legendary white dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul>\n<li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair.</li>\n<li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.</li>\n<li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon’s lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.\n\tIf the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li>\n</ul><br>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Ice Walk</strong>: The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.<br><br><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Tail</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Frightful Presence</strong>: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 ft. of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br><h2>Legendary Actions</h2>Can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.<br><br><strong>Detect</strong>: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong>Tail Attack</strong>: The dragon makes a tail attack.<br><br><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.<br>\n<hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p>Glazhael is an adult white dragon that is doing his part to ensure the rise of Tiamat, hopeful that the queen of evil dragons will reward him with untold power. He is, however, a bit on the dim side, thinking of visitors as either servants (who bring him food) or as enemies (who do not bring him food). Mostly, Glazhael is proud to guard this treasure for Tiamat, his most glorious and perfect queen. He rarely talks to any cultists other than Talis and is suspicious of Rezmir and the others.<br><br>\nIf the characters speak with Glazhael, he responds with a pompous speech about the superiority of dragons over humans, dwarves, and so forth.<br><br>If the characters flatter him to a ludicrous degree, he listens to anything that sounds like fawning, servile, helpful obedience but offers nothing in return. He will generously spare the lives of those who offer him tribute in the form of treasure or food. Those who challenge him become targets of his breath weapon.<br><br>\nWhen fighting, Glazhael clings to the ceiling whenever possible, using his breath weapon and Frightful Presence to start. If that doesn’t scare the characters off, he makes melee attacks until his breath weapon recharges. If dropped to fewer than 40 hit points, he flees. He can navigate even the narrow tunnels by tucking in his wings. Once outside, he alerts the rest of the castle, shouting “They’re after the treasure!” in Draconic.<br><br>\nClever characters can lure the dragon into a narrow tunnel where it is unable to maneuver effectively. Under such circumstances, the dragon has disadvantage on its melee attacks.<br></section>","public":""},"race":"","type":"dragon","environment":"","cr":13,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10000},"source":"Roll 20","class":""},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonus":0,"mod":6,"passive":16},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"prc":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":11,"passive":21},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonus":0,"mod":-1,"passive":9},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":0,"passive":10},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","bonus":0,"mod":5,"passive":15},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonus":0,"mod":1,"passive":11}},"traits":{"size":"huge","senses":"blindsight 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 21","languages":{"value":["common","draconic"],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["cold"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"perception":{"_deprecated":true}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"max":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"_deprecated":true}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":3,"max":3},"legres":{"value":3,"max":3},"lair":{"value":true,"initiative":20}}},"folder":"ZjY5YjI4MjZlYzIx","sort":30000,"flags":{"dnd5e":{"saveBonus":0}},"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/003_-_Adult_White_Dragon/avatar.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Adult White Dragon","displayName":40,"img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/003_-_Adult_White_Dragon/token.png","tint":null,"width":3,"height":3,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":135,"brightSight":120,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"actorId":"ZjhkM2Y4N2NhY2Jh","actorLink":false,"actorData":{"data":{"attributes":{"bar1":{"value":200,"max":200},"bar2":{"value":18,"max":0}}}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.bar1"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.bar2"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"ZTIxYmRlMTJjNmVl","flags":{},"name":"Ice Walk.","type":"feat","img":"worlds/hoard-of-the-dragon-queen/characters/003_-_Adult_White_Dragon/avatar.png","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check.
